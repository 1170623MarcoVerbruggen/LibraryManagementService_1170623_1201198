## Issue: Domain Object ID dependent on Database Management Service

### Problem

How to ensure the system can identify domain data in a persistence-agnostic manner

### Summary of Solution

Implement algorithms to generate unique IDs in the system regardless of persistence method

### Factors

* Current system can only identify data based on the ID generated by the database used
* Persistence methods can change and cannot be relied on for functioning of the system beyond the persistence of data itself
* The system must be able to identify different instances of a domain object without relying on external services or factors


### Solution

* Implement a persistent ID value on classes representing domain entities, to be generated by an algorithm in the system.
* Multiple ID generation methods should be configurable. 
* Defined ID structures:
  * 24 character hexadecimal code
  * 20 character alphanumerical hash

### Motivation

* Increase the reliability of the system by reducing reliance on external services
* Increase the extensibility of the system by allowing future additions of further ID generation methods
* Increase the configurability of the system by allowing selection of ID Generation method

### Alternatives

* Implement extensive comparison methods in domain model classes to identify instances by the totality of its definition
  * Requires unique implementation for each current and potential (future) domain class and constant running of comparison algorithms
* Implement standard UUID generation

### Pending Issues

* How to resolve the problem with a more efficient solution
* How to, as much as possible, ensure uniqueness of IDs with current methods
